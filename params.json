You can help contribute to this project by pulling the latest code and exploring the framework. Check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Crunching Code Components\r\nWe have tackled some very common and sometimes not so common tasks and problems in the framework to make building applications much easier for you. Some of our modules include:\r\n* SMS\r\n* USSD\r\n* Business Model\r\n* Authentication\r\n* Social Integration\r\n* Reporting\r\n* Templates (Mobile Applications & Web Applications)\r\n* much more...\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project was founded by @CrunchingCode in 2015 and is heavily maintained and updated by @MaziMuhlari and @Vhutie.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble or need help getting started?
